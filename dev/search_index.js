So far, the project is a layer on Chemfiles.jl, which is used to read PDB files.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Plans are to include a small and lightweight parser for PDB files.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"The model of protein structure is completely different from the hierarchical model of BioStructures.jl.

Structures for atom trajectories can be borrowed from existing crystal data through lending.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"As of writing, the package provides a way to extract some structural information from Frame objects from Chemfiles.jl. Extracted information is stored in a StructureFrame object. This was the preferred way to obtain structural information through different formats, and this was thought to allow the analysis of changes in structural information from a trajectory.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Through benchmarks, it was found out that this method of extraction is  significantly slow, and it is planned to write a small and lightweight parser  in Julia for PDB files.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Naturally, the package aims to provide certain geometric constructs needed for protein structure analysis. These include:","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Backbone hydrogen bonding models\nRamachandran plots\nGeometry utilities: distances, angle measures (bond angle, dihedral angle)\nSecondary structure assignment methods (DSSP, STRIDE, KAKSI, etc.)","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"Since there are many methods for secondary structure assignment methods, it is envisioned that the package can provide the necessary tools for its abstraction. This is can be important for work that requires comparison between methods, or analyses that require nonstandard secondary structure assignments [1].","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"[1]: \"Nonstandard\" here means those that are not DSSP.","category":"page"},{"location":"#More-on-topology-lending-concept","page":"Introduction","title":"More on topology lending concept","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"The main contribution of this package is the topology lending concept for protein atom trajectories from simulation data.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"It can be said that generally in simulations with a constant number of atoms, especially for biomolecular simulations involving proteins, the protein topology (atom and residue connectivities) remain the same throughout the simulation [2]. This suggests that there may be no need to allocate data for the protein topology in each recorded frame in a trajectory.","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"[2]: Except of course when considering bond breaking in reactive force fields","category":"page"},{"location":"#Slight-disclaimer","page":"Introduction","title":"Slight disclaimer","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"","page":"Introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"This module does not aim to provide a fast workflow for analyzing protein structures, but a readable set of functions to the original author.","category":"page"}]
